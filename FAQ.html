                    <h3>1.WHAT IS IT SUPPORT?</h3>
                    <div>
                        Technically speaking, IT support is defined in the Cambridge Dictionary as "technical help or knowledge provided by computing experts...a team or department in a company or organization that provides technical help to people who have problems with its computer systems".
                    </div>
                    <h3>2.HOW MUCH DOES IT SUPPORT COST?</h3>
                    <div>
                        On average, hourly IT support for business costs range from $75-200 per hour. This can of course vary wildly based on your location, the services needed, the experience of the provider, emergency service needs, and the time commitment required to solve the issue.
                    </div>
                    <h3>3.WHAT IS MANAGED IT SERVICE?</h3>
                    <div>
                        Managed IT service involves a business partnering with an outside IT company to oversee and manage all of their technology (and sometimes overall company) needs. It can act as a replacement for or supplement to an internal IT person or team.
                    </div>
                    <h3>4.WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS AND RISKS TO MANAGED SERVICES?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <b>Benefits</b> - Access to a team of IT people for the price of one internally, unloading IT management responsibilities, predictable monthly spend, preventing instead of reacting to issues, staying up to date with the latest technology, virtual CIO services and advising, and overall peace of mind knowing your technology is reliable and secure.
                        <b>Risks</b> - Paying for managed services but receiving standard break-fix IT service, being scammed or taken advantage of by less reputable providers, giving full access of your network to an outside company, being coerced into using technology you don't want or need, being locked into a contract with a poorly-performing provider.
                    </div>
                    <h3>5.WILL COMPUTERS TAKE MY JOB?</h3>
                    <div>
                        On a broad scale - probably not! We're of the mindset that computers and advancements in AI will take over the boring, tedious, repetitive parts of our jobs (which most of us hate anyway). Humans will be left to tackle the more creative, strategic tasks that computers aren't great at.
                    </div>
                    <h3>6.WHAT ROLE DOES TECHNOLOGY PLAY IN BUSINESS?</h3>
                    <div>
                        It's a rare business that can operate in this day and age without technology! Internet access, computers, phones, printers, tablets, software, apps, and more are necessary for the vast majority of companies. While we theoretically could run a company without them, would you want to?
